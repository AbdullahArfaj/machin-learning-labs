The Global Cars Dataset contains information about different car models, including their brand, year, engine size, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and price. Each row represents one car, and each column represents a specific feature.

The main goal of the dataset is to analyze the factors that affect car prices. If used for machine learning, it represents a **regression problem**, where the target variable is **Price**, and the model aims to predict car prices based on features such as engine size, year, and mileage.
