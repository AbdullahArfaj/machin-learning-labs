problem statment : The objective of this project is to build a machine learning regression model that predicts the price of a car based on its specifications and characteristics. By analyzing historical car data, the model learns how different features influence car prices and produces accurate price predictions for unseen data.

Is this a regression, classification, or clustering problem?
This is a regression problem because the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value.

Is there a target variable?
Yes. The target variable is Price_USD, which represents the car price in US dollars.

What is the model expected to learn or predict?
The model is expected to learn the relationship between car features (such as brand, year, engine size, horsepower, mileage, fuel type, and transmission) and the car price, and then use this knowledge to predict the price of new cars.
